            <h2>How did I get here?</h2>
            <h3>31 March, 2020</h3>
            <p>Of course I do know about the birds and bees, the stork and evolution in general...</p>
            <p>But until I watched this 15 minute video on youtube, I was lost in the documentation of GitHub pages. Whilst I love open source and the community, there is a lot to be desired for their documentation.</p>
            <p>Whilst google was my friend and I'll leave the title of 'saviour' to ProgrammingKnowledge2 on YouTube. Seriously dude, you saved me on this one.</p>

            <h2>Revolutionize Your Page - Lecture by Jen Simmons</h2>
            <h3>29 March, 2020</h3>
            <p>Yeah, I love Jen's lectures and YouTube content. <em>Sue me.</em></p>
            <p>Whilst I would normally recommend one of her sub 15 minute videos, this is a an older presentation of hers (October 2018) that I feel is still very relevant.</p>
            <p>I would go so far to stay that this presentation is essential viewing for all developers for both budding newbies and experienced old dogs alike. The way that she highlights the advances in HTML 5 and CSS 3 and how they can be used to build better content with a MVC approach is one for the ages.</p>

            <h2>CSS Grid: Moving from CSS Frameworks - presented by Daniel Koskinen</h2>
            <h3>28 March, 2020</h3>
            <p>Daniel Koskinen's presentation on how CSS grid can be used to replace most layout functionality that was previously only accomplished with frameworks is brilliant. By directly comparing what is industry standard with what CSS Grid provides, he draws a direct connection between the two and leaves you feeling that using the grid is a far simpler yet superior way of accomplishing layout within sites and web applications</p>
            <p>What I particularly liked is that he presents the information so clearly that even a person such as myself with some intermediate CSS knowledge does not feel patronised. </p>
            <p>To be honest, he has made believe that learning the previous frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation are only necessary to provide legacy support for content that has been built with them prior to CSS Grid. This has reduced my anxiety around the big question "What frameworks should I learn?"</p>

            <h2>9 Biggest Mistakes with CSS Grid - Jen Simmons</h2>
            <h3>28 March, 2020</h3>
            <p>Attention anyone still using percentages in CSS Grid. Or only percentages for sizing in general. Prepare to be offended. Prepare to eat a big slice of ye olde humble pie as you are scowled at by a wise Mozilla crone.</p>
            <p>If anyone on the internet was to tell you that you are doing it wrong, please let it be Jen Simmons. Seriously, that scowl. If that doesn't stop you doing what you are doing and to start paying attention, nothing will.</p>
            <p>Jen delivers her top 9 top ten pet peeves about how CSS grid is beng used in the savage wild that is modern web development. And she does so with the seething hatred that could only ever be matched with Calpernia Addams' "Bad questions to Ask a Transsexual." If you know that video, you'll know what you're in for from Jen. Albiet Jen is a lot more subtle like an agony aunt talking you through your most recent dumbest mistake in life...</p>
