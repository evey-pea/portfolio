            <h2>tare-csv</h2>
            <p>This was a terminal application assignment from my coding boot camp. Essentially we had free choice over what to build as a terminal application using the Ruby programming language. As I was wanting to learn more about reading and writing CSV files, the project I chose to do was a command line CSV file reader and editor.</p>
            <p>Shamelessly this is lifted from the README file...</p>
            <blockquote>
                The application allows for the reading and editing of CSV files via a command prompt when a GUI program is not suitable or available to do so. It reads out (either in part or in full) the contents of the file to the screen. The user can also nominate a singular line to edit. <br><br>
                In some instances such as a remotely logging into a machine or server via a tty terminal client, a CSV data file may need to have its contents examined and/or edited.

            <h2>Ruby Hackathon: DASS Testing</h2>
            <p>In order to refresh our Ruby skills and to help bust up the boredom of working from home during the COVID-19 episode, our class was assigned an open project: <em>Build a terminal application to be useful for people staying at home</em></p>
            <p>Since it was obivious that people's mental health would be at risk and require assessment, the team that I was apart of decided to build a version of the DASS21/42 diagnostic test. The idea was free up the health practioner's time by having the computer ask the questions to help assist with their workload.</p>
